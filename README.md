# B.O.X
Basic Option Experience. A box I made for class that you communicate with through two buttons, yes and no. The purpose of the assignment was to create a 12x12x12 box that would invite a user to interact, and keep them there as long as possible.

I designed the box to be simple and mysterious. I painted the box black, to hint at a 'black box' element where you do not know what it inside. The lettering on the front says 'MR. B.O.X' and serves two purposes. First the word 'MR.' indicates that the box may have its own personality and character. Second, the fact that B.O.X is an acronym indicates that this is more than just a box.

On the top of the box are two bottons, highlighted in red squares. Angled above each button are labels, 'YES' and 'NO'. I designed this section to resemble a face, the buttons being the eyes, the lettering the eyebrows, and the split in the box being the mouth.

There are no instructions, but the users interest will quickly reveal the dynamics of the box. Pressing either of the buttons will prompt a voice from inside, "Hello. Do you know what I am?" Immediatly the user understands the dynamic of the relationship. The box asks questions, and I answer.

There are 9 different possible endings and 28 total recorded dialogs, not including a special dialog that plays if you take too long to respond to a question.

The entire thing is powered by a raspberry pi, a small speaker, a portable phone charger, and some wires soldered to some buttons. The program can be run in keyboard mode by providing a -k flag. This lets me run it on my computer and test it.

Thank you for reading.
